# **App Name**: Monopoly Mapper

## Core Features:

- Property Generation: AI-powered tool to generate a list of properties tailored to a theme, complete with property groups of similar entities, mirroring the classic Monopoly board structure. For instance, a theme like "Kansas City" might yield properties such as Joe's KC, Union Station, and Power & Light District.
- Property Display: Display the generated properties grouped by likeness, each assigned a distinct color scheme, similar to the property groupings in Monopoly.
- Edit Mode: Allows the user to manually curate properties, color groupings, and names for each entity displayed.
- Export Results: Export the properties and groupings into different file formats, and saved to the user's computer.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#3F51B5) to represent strategy and thoughtfulness, as generating properties from a central theme is not trivial.
- Background color: Very light Blue (#E8EAF6) to let the deep blue pop from the background. Visually similar to the primary hue.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800) as it is highly visible compared to the other shades.
- Use a clean, readable sans-serif font to ensure readability.
- Display the information in a structured, card-based layout.
- Gentle transitions and feedback animations to improve UX when users are generating a board.
